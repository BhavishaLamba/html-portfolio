 <h1>The best movies According to Bhavisha</h1>
 <h2>Here are my top 3 selction</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>Chhava</h3>
 <p>I like this movie.Because of its drama,emotions,and politics.
    I liked about this movie is a thought of Shivaji maharaj.
    That is one nation with different religious and with full freedom and safety of each one of nations people.
     And after shivaji sambhaji maharaj take all responsiblity to hold this thought and build the nations dreamed by shivaji maharaj.
 
<br /> I personally preferd to you to watch the movie,and take experince of shivaji maharaj's thought.    </p>
<h3>Tare Zameen par</h3>
<p>I like this movie.Because it show us that every child is special.
    The most importent thing that i learned from this movie is "Don't compare your child with anyone".
Your child has unique identity.
As a parent we should understand the survive of child from any problem that they faced.  <br />
I recommend you to watch movie to see the difficulty of every children they faced .</p>
<h3>Dilwaale Dulhaniya Le Jayege</h3>
<p>I like this movie beacause the chemistry of kajol and sharukhkhan is so beautiful.
    And the movie director show us the london's culture and punjab's culture as well.
    most about i like this picture is its songs so touchy and whole movie desgin beautifull.
    <br />
    I recommend you to watch the movie to see the scenery of london and punjab 
    and first emotion comes in life at the age of adultness.
